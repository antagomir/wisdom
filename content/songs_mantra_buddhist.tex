\beginsong{Om Mani Padme Hum \\ Om Mani Peme Hung \\ Compassion Mantra}[]
  \beginverse
    Om Mani Padme Hum
  \endverse
  \begin{feeler}
    Om, the jewel (method; mani) in the lotus (wisdom; padme), indivisible (hum). 
    Hail to the Jewel in the Lotus.
  \end{feeler}
  \begin{explanation}
    Lama Thubken Trinley: "These six syllables prevent rebirth into the six realms of cyclic 
    existence. It translates as 'OM the jewel in the lotus HUM'. OM prevents rebirth in the God 
    realm, MA prevents rebirth in the Asura (Titan) realm, NI prevents rebirth in the Human realm, 
    PA prevents rebirth in the Animal realm, ME prevents rebirth in the Hungry Ghost realm, and 
    HUM prevents rebirth in the Hell Realm."

    The 14th Dalai Lama: "It is very good to recite the mantra Om mani padme hum, but while doing 
    it, think the meaning of the six syllables which is great and vast... The first, Om [\ldots ] 
    symbolizes the practitioner's impure body, speech, and mind; it also symbolizes the pure 
    exalted body, speech, and mind of a Buddha[\ldots ]" "The path is indicated by the next four 
    syllables. Mani, meaning jewel, symbolizes the factors of method: (the) altruistic intention 
    to become enlightened, compassion, and love." 

    "Purity must be achieved by an indivisible unity of method and wisdom, symbolized by the final 
    syllable HUM, which indicates indivisibility" 

    "Thus the six syllables mean that in dependence on the practice of a path which is an 
    indivisible union of method and wisdom, you can transform your impure body, speech, and mind 
    into the pure exalted body, speech, and mind of a Buddha[\ldots ]"
