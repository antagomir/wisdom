  \end{feeler}
  \begin{explanation}
    % From a lecture given by The Dalai Lama at the Kalmuck Mongolian Buddhist Center, New Jersey:
    \textbf{The 14th Dalai Lama:} ``It is very good to recite the mantra OM MANI PADME HUM, but
    while doing it, think the meaning of the six syllables which is great and vast.\par
    The first, OM [\ldots] symbolizes the practitioner's impure body, speech, and mind; it also
    symbolizes the pure exalted body, speech, and mind of a Buddha. [\ldots]\par
    The path is indicated by the next four syllables. MANI, meaning jewel, symbolizes the
    factors of method: the altruistic intention to become enlightened, compassion, and
    love. [\ldots]\par
    The two syllables, PADME, meaning lotus, symbolize wisdom. Just as a lotus grows forth
    from mud but is not sullied by the faults of mud, so wisdom is capable of putting you in
    a situation of non-contradiction where as there would be contradiction if you did not have
    wisdom. [\ldots]\par
    Purity must be achieved by an indivisible unity of method and wisdom, symbolized by the
    final syllable HUM, which indicates indivisibility. [\ldots]\par
    Thus the six syllables mean that in dependence on the practice of a path which is an
    indivisible union of method and wisdom, you can transform your impure body, speech, and
    mind into the pure exalted body, speech, and mind of a Buddha. [\ldots]''
    % % Commented out for ..mm.. reasons
    %\textbf{Lama Thubken Trinley:} ``These six syllables prevent rebirth into the six realms of
    %cyclic existence. It translates as 'OM the jewel in the lotus HUM'. OM prevents rebirth
    %in the God realm, MA prevents rebirth in the Asura (Titan) realm, NI prevents rebirth in
    %the Human realm, PA prevents rebirth in the Animal realm, ME prevents rebirth in the
    %Hungry Ghost realm, and HUM prevents rebirth in the Hell Realm.''

  \begin{explanation}
    \textbf{Padmasambhava} was a historical teacher in the 8th century, who is regarded
    as the founder of the Nyingma tradition. He is said to have been a renowned
    scholar, meditator, and magician --- the 'second Buddha' in the minds of many
    in Tibet.
    \begin{description}
      \item Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche:

        ``It is said that the twelve syllables Om Ah Hum Vajra Guru Padme Siddhi Hum carry
        the entire blessing of the twelve types of teaching taught by Buddha, which are the
        essence of His 84000 Dharmas\ldots''
      \item Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo:

        ``It begins with \textbf{OM AH HUM}, which are the seed syllables of the three vajras (of body,
        speech and mind).

        \textbf{VAJRA} signifies the \emph{dharmakaya} [\emph{Truth body} which embodies the very
        principle of enlightenment and knows no limits or boundaries] since, like the adamantine vajra,
        it cannot be 'cut' or destroyed by the elaborations of conceptual thought.

        \textbf{GURU} signifies the \emph{sambhogakaya} [\emph{body of mutual enjoyment} which is
        a body of bliss or clear light manifestation], which is 'heavily' laden with the qualities of the
        seven aspects of union.

        \textbf{PADME} signifies the \emph{nirmanakaya} [\emph{created body} which manifests in time
        and space], the radiant awareness of the wisdom of discernment arising as the lotus family of
        enlightened speech.

        Remembering the qualities of the great Guru of Oddiyana [Padmasambhava], who is inseparable from these
        three kayas, pray with the continuous devotion that is the intrinsic display of the nature
        of mind, free from the elaboration of conceptual thought.

        All the supreme and ordinary accomplishments — \textbf{SIDDHI} — are obtained through the power of
        this prayer, and by thinking, `\textbf{HUM}! May they be bestowed upon my mindstream, this very
        instant!'''

  \endchorus
  \begin{explanation}
    \textbf{Amitābha} is the principal buddha in Pure Land Buddhism, a branch of East Asian Buddhism.
    In Vajrayana Buddhism, Amitābha is known for his longevity attribute, magnetising red fire
    element, the aggregate of discernment, pure perception and the deep awareness of emptiness of
    phenomena. According to these scriptures, Amitābha possesses infinite merits resulting from good
    deeds over countless past lives as a bodhisattva named Dharmakāra. Amitābha means ``Infinite Light''
    so Amitābha is also called ``The Buddha of Immeasurable Life and Light''.\\
    Buddhists take refuge in the \emph{Three Jewels} or \emph{Triple Gem}, which are:
    \begin{description}
      \item[\hspace{2em} Buddha:] the fully enlightened one
      \item[\hspace{2em} Dharma:] the teachings (expounded by the Buddha)
      \item[\hspace{2em} Sangha:] the spiritual community (the monastic order of Buddhism that practice the Dharma)

    emotional and spiritual suffering.

    Tara has 21 forms, of which two are especially popular among Tibetan people: \emph{White Tara},
    who is associated with compassion and long life, and \emph{Green Tara}, who is associated with

    Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha, cast as the overall teacher of the tradition, illustrates 
    the point that without a good teacher in the beginning there can be no success in spiritual
