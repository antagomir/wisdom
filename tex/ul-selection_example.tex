 %% Selection of songs from unilaiva-songbook: an example
 %% =====================================================
 %%
 %% To create your own selection, just make a copy of this file named
 %% ul-selection_SOMETHING.tex in the project root, and edit the new
 %% file to have correct \mainbooktitle and \includeonlysongs, then
 %% run the compile script.
 %%
 %% To use a custom image as a cover, create a single page PDF of it,
 %% put it in content/img, and uncomment \coverpdf command below (in
 %% your new file) and set the correct file name (without path).
 %%
 %% The compile script will automatically compile every selection booklet,
 %% which is named ul-selection_*.tex and put in the root directory of the
 %% project.

\documentclass[twoside,10pt]{book}

%% Set the title of this document:
\newcommand{\mainbooktitle}{Example selection}

%% Uncomment this and set the filename without path (the file must be found
%% in content/img), to use a single-page PDF as a cover. Otherwise a cover
%% will be generated.
% \newcommand{\coverpdf}{my_selection_cover.pdf}

%% The following required package contains all the imports, style settings etc:
\usepackage{tex/unilaiva-songbook_common}
