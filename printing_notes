### Howto: print A5 double sided on single sided A4 printer ###
###############################################################

## Note that the printer probably has forced margins which will
## be added to the ones defined in the PDF, resulting in wider
## margins and smaller text.

# Print wisdom_odd.pdftk
## 2 Pages Per Sheet
## Order: Left To Right, Top to Bottom (default)

# Flip each printed page one-by-one like this:
## 1. Set the printed stack of sheets in front of you so that the text is
##    displayed like it should (not upside down)
## 2. Turn the *whole* stack upside down as if turning a page of a book.
##    Now you have a stack of sheets with their blank side up.
## 3. Make a new stack with each page flipped by moving each page from
##    the old turned stack one-by-one to the new stack without turning it in
##    any way, from the
##    top of the old turned stack to the top of the new stack. In the end
##    you will have a stack which has the sheets in the original order but
##    each flipped so that the blank space is up 
## 4. Feed the new stack (without turning it) to the printer
