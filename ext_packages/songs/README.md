 This folder contains the file `songs-x.y.tar.gz`, which is the complete
 archived distribution of the songs package.

 The other three files are extracted from the above mentioned archive file:

   - `songs.sty`: the songs package, a required file for compiling the songbook
   - `songidx.lua`: used in creating indices, a required file for compiling
                    the songbook
   - `songs.pdf`: the songs package documentation, acquired by compiling the
                  package (not required)

There is other stuff, including samples, inside the archive. See the `README`
file inside.
